# Receive, Download, and Reply with media in WhatsApp Messages. Powered by Twilio - Python/Flask

Use Twilio to receive WhatsApp media messages. For a step-by-step tutorial see
the [Twilio docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/whatsapp/tutorial/send-and-receive-media-messages-whatsapp-python).

## Local development

This project is built using the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web
framework. It runs on Python 3.6+.

To run the app locally:

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:TwilioDevEd/whatsapp-media-tutorial-flask.git
   cd whatsapp-media-tutorial-flask
   ```

1. Create a new virtual environment using
   [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

   ```bash
   virtualenv -p python3 venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

1. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Run the application

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

1. Expose your application to the wider internet using
   [ngrok](http://ngrok.com/). This step is important because the
   application won't work as expected if you run it through localhost.

   ```bash
   ngrok http -host-header=localhost 8000
   ```

   **Note:** You can read
   [this blog post](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/6-awesome-reasons-to-use-ngrok-when-testing-webhooks.html)
   for more details on how to use ngrok.

1. Configure Twilio's Sandbox for WhatsApp to call your webhook URL

   You will need to configure your [Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/whatsapp/sandbox) to call your application (exposed via ngrok) when your Sandbox number receives an incoming message. Your URL will look something like this:

   ```
   http://6b5f6b6d.ngrok.io/whatsapp/
   ```

   Here are detailed instructions for [Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/whatsapp/api#twilio-sandbox-for-whatsapp)

1. Check it out at http://localhost:5000

## How to Demo

1. Send a message with a media attachment to your WhatsApp Sandbox phone number

1. Your Flask application should display the incoming request from Twilio. In a few moments, you should get back a WhatsApp reply featuring a "good boy."
